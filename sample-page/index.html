<p>Should we say that IQ’s exist? The answer may be yes or no depending on the facts attached to the response. This week I read an article about how brain structure affects human task performance. In this article, researchers used a data-driven computational modeling approach to explore the functions and differences in brain networks. Also, with computational experiments, they measured the excitability of the brain network which influences the capacity of performance. After, they combined computational results to individual variability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks, both before and after transcranial which stimulates nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. Mainly researchers wanted to link the variability in brain structure and behavior. For each experiment, they designed a subject-specific brain network depending on the specific language task requirements and involved individuals. Specifically, the tasks were number reading, sentence completion, and verb generation.</p>



<p>Within the sample of ten individuals who did language cognitive tasks before and after TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) which activate brain activity with rapidly changing magnetic fields. Similarly, they used nonlinear Wilson-Cowan oscillators which I was not able to understand what it is, but they used it to model each brain region. Also, from WCO they mentioned the mean behavior of small neuronal populations. The model generates macro-level brain activity within a specific time and space. As shown in Fig 2c, the evaluation of language task performance for the ten participants through taking the response times for three language-demanding tasks. Also, they evaluated an individual’s performance concerning brain structure by estimating the correlation between global brain activation and task performance. As shown on a graph of response times against transition value of verb generation (VG), sentence completion (SC), and number reading on figure 3 a, b and c respectively. The correlation between these values and their performance on each task is positive and equal to 0.86 with a confidence interval of 90% CI ([0.68 0.95]). It means that for any changes in brain structure, there is also a similar change in performance. Specifically, they occur in phase.</p>



<p>Moreover, authors indicated that the higher complexity of the cognitive task, “a larger portion of the brain network, including interhemispheric connections, contribute in determining the overall response” (Bansal et al., n.d). We can determine the excitability or functionality of everyman’s brain through performing any activity.&nbsp; It’s also conducive to brain structure and performance as well. Besides, they represented variability as the standard deviation of the average regional functional connectivity across individuals divided by the regional mean of functional connectivity across individuals, and this identifies a correlation between two data sets. In conclusion, the article was mainly to examine the variability between brain structure networks and functionality in various real-life tasks including language cognitive.&nbsp; With different configurations and analysis, the result was a perfect positive correlation which means both sample tests were linearly related and a 90% confidence interval. However, to compute brain model dynamics, they use Wilson-Cowan oscillators which I was not able to understand. The article can be found</p>

<h5>High strength metallic wood from nanostructured nickel inverse opal materials</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ouwayo.github.io/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/45.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In collaboration with the University of Cambridge, Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign the researchers have developed a robust metallic wood material which is strong as titanium and four times much lighter than titanium. This material exhibits mechanical properties of metal such as high energy absorption, high specific strength, and ultra-low density. It’s designed to hold mechanical loads.&nbsp; In addition, it can be easily fabricated and processed at room temperature. Also, the uniqueness of this material, it has higher strain energy storage which means it can fit a myriad of applications such as sensors, energy storage, and heat transfer materials.&nbsp; The structure of such material is made of nickel with nanoscale pores and the density as of water (1,000 kg/m3) and has the exception of being porous, and it can transport ions. However, according to the researcher’s Metallic wood is not yet out for commercial production it is still under testing.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the metallic wood material can be made stronger if the researchers also try to use composite material with high strength and lightweight — for example, Carbon and epoxy many years of experiment, epoxy have been a dependable material which is cheaper, and it’s easy to process.&nbsp; In fact, epoxy has numerous mechanical properties that qualify in many places as nanostructured nickel inverse opal material does. Specifically, epoxy and carbon have strong tension, heat resistance, and chemical resistance. In addition, this can be a protective component of many devices because it may make them more resistant to impact and flexible weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, this composite material does not corrode or degrade which means it is environmentally friendly.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Metallic wood which existed from nanostructured Nickel will be the best material to perform many of the biological functions. Also, it will work in conjunction with Titanium because it appeared to have almost the same features. On the other hand, the composite of Carbon and Epoxy would do the same as I suggest more research on how Epoxy and Carbon can be developed to work in similar situations with either Titanium or Metallic wood. The article can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36901-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36901-3</a></p>



<h5>Machine learning classification for field distributions of photonic modes</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ouwayo.github.io/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/data3-1024x969.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The traditional paper-based system of keeping data was secured and reliable. However, technology advancement proved the limited access and idleness of data which is today the precious commodity everyone wishes to possess. In fact, the recent technology uses data and past information to instruct machines what to do through the use of statistical techniques which give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. I read an article about Machine learning classification for field distributions of photonic modes; machine learning techniques can reveal hidden structures in large amounts of data and have the potential to replace analytical scientific methods. Also, explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions from any data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the article, to identify the phonic modes they used clustering method which highlights the patterns in unlabeled data and has revealed parts of hidden structures which have been applied to anomaly detection (outlier detection). Also, this technique of clustering can withstand the 3D electromagnetic field distribution data. In figure 4, they used silhouette analysis which is an interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data. On this figure, the silhouette coefficients for each sample are plotted as a bar in the x-direction with a length corresponding to its value. The samples are sorted by their silhouette coefficients, with smaller values located at smaller y-positions. Also, the red dashed lines on the graph indicate the silhouette score which ranges from -1 to 1 and for the higher value means the object is well matched to its cluster and poorly to its neighboring and vice versa. Also, when is 0 it implies that the sample is close to the boundary between its own and the adjacent cluster, and negative values indicate that it’s assigned to the wrong cluster.&nbsp; Specifically, on figure 6c, they presented random distribution of data by small spheres, and each corresponds to the field energy density at their specific positions.</p>



<p>Through all these models and machine learning training, they used Gaussian mixture model clustering. Particularly, k means algorithms which they explained as a method of vector quantization for signal processing. But then, an issue is that k mean assumes that the clusters are circular, and the authors said this might result in getting a wrong measurement and imperfect prediction. Since to identify the centroid, clusters pretend to have the same center with these spheres, which means any approximation error might mess up the next result. However, I couldn’t understand the formula, especially variables, are not explained. In real life, this method of analyzing quantum digital signatures could be used in spectral conversion in solar energy, biosensing, and vitro diagnostics.</p>



<p>Moreover, many of the formulas in this article lack clear explanation, but the results presentations are perfect. Mostly the authors explain the mechanism of them, but the variables implications are not determined before being used. Specifically, finite element method (FEM) simulations, where authors say that “the matrix for the clustering algorithm is composed and used to perform the clustering itself” (Barth &amp;Becker, n.d). There is no methodology of correcting this matrix from photonic modes.&nbsp; In conclusion, the clusters are well presented, and it’s easy to see the variations of photons and some 3D schematic which shows changes on the field’s distribution data in xy, xz, and yz planes (figure 1c).
